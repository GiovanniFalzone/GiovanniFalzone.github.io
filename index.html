				<h1 class="content">Who am I</h1>
				<p>I'm a technology enthusiast born in Sicily and moving around following my passion.</p>
				<p>The first toy that I remember was an old DOS personal computer when my father moved to a machine with Windows 95.</p>
				<p>Since I remember I liked opening, breaking, fixing and thinkering with everything provided of a microchip and mechanical parts.</p>
				<p>For several reason I decided to study in a Classical high school but my passion was the tech so continued it in my little free time and with extra-curriculum courses like Robotics and Programming in other schools.</p>
				<p>Once finished the high school I moved in Pisa to start the bachelor degree in Computer Engineering at University of Pisa, during my free time I continued growing my passion developing personal projects and making experience with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.</p>
				<p>Completed the Bachelor degree in 2016 I decided to continue studying for the master's degree in Embedded Computing System at Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies and University of Pisa</p>
				<p>The master's degree courses were amazing, full of applyied projects, the time was never enough but the passion helped to continue working day by day.</p>
				<p>The courses spreads on several topics regarding Hardware, Real Time Systems, Vrtualization, IoT, Machine learning, Virtual and Augmented Realty, Industrial Application and Innovation, Robotics, Mechatrocis...</p>
